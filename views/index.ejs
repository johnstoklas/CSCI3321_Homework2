        <p> Regardless of my strange eating habits, I will do my best to list foods and recipes that I eat. 
          My favorite food is probably chicken and rice because itâ€™s simple to make and healthy. 
          For the last two years I have been trying to strictly eat on campus, specifically Mabee Dining Hall, so I have been eating lots of chicken and rice recently. </p>
